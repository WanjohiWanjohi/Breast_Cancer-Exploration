### Description
The repository contains a brief introductory project to classification method of machine learning and makes use of the following models:
  - Naive Bayes (GaussianNaiveBayes from sklearn.classification)
  - Logistic Regression (LogisticRegression from sklearn.linear)
### Data
The data used herein is found as part of the sklearn datasets and contains attributes such as:


    radius (mean of distances from center to points on the perimeter)

    texture (standard deviation of gray-scale values)

    perimeter

    area

    smoothness (local variation in radius lengths)

    compactness (perimeter^2 / area - 1.0)

    concavity (severity of concave portions of the contour)

    concave points (number of concave portions of the contour)

    symmetry

    fractal dimension (“coastline approximation” - 1)
### Objective
Using the features provided , predict the class of breast cancer ; whether malignant or benign

### Perfomance
The model performance metric used is the accuracy
